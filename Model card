Model Card: Risk-Adjusted Kernel UCB Optimisation (RA-KRR-UCB v1.0)

1. Overview

Model Name: Risk-Adjusted Kernel UCB Optimiser (RA-KRR-UCB)
Type: Surrogate-based Bayesian Black-Box Optimisation
Version: Stage 2 (Round 10, ~19 observations per function)

This model is an uncertainty-aware optimisation strategy designed for sequential black-box optimisation. It combines:
	•	Kernel Ridge Regression (RBF kernel) surrogate modelling
	•	Cross-validated hyperparameter tuning
	•	Bootstrap ensemble uncertainty estimation
	•	Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition
	•	Risk-adjusted scoring and boundary penalties
	•	Mixed global (Sobol) and local candidate sampling

The approach evolves across rounds as more data become available.

2. Intended Use

Suitable for:
	•	Low- to medium-dimensional black-box optimisation problems (2–8 dimensions)
	•	Sequential query settings with strict submission constraints
	•	Scenarios requiring transparent and reproducible decision-making
	•	Educational or research contexts exploring exploration–exploitation trade-offs

Should be avoided for:
	•	Highly discontinuous or adversarial objective functions
	•	Extremely high-dimensional optimisation (>10–15 dimensions)
	•	Settings requiring formal Bayesian posterior uncertainty guarantees
	•	Real-world deployment without additional robustness validation

⸻

3. Details of the Approach

Early Rounds (1–3)
	•	Emphasis on exploration.
	•	Larger Sobol candidate budgets.
	•	Higher exploration weight (kappa).
	•	Minimal local anchoring.

Middle Rounds (4–7)
	•	Surrogate begins identifying promising regions.
	•	Introduced structured local sampling around top-performing observations.
	•	Added bootstrap ensemble variance to approximate uncertainty.
	•	Began tuning alpha and gamma via cross-validation.

Later Rounds (8–10)
	•	Adaptive scaling of:
	•	Candidate budget
	•	Ensemble size
	•	Exploration strength (kappa)
	•	Introduced risk-adjusted scoring:
	•	Penalised high uncertainty (risk_lambda)
	•	Penalised distance from known data
	•	Penalised boundary-hugging points
	•	Added shortlist sampling (temperature/top-p/top-k) to reduce brittle candidate selection.

Decision Mechanism

For each round and function:
	1.	Standardise inputs.
	2.	Tune KRR hyperparameters (alpha, gamma).
	3.	Estimate noise proxy via CV.
	4.	Generate global + local candidate sets.
	5.	Compute mean and ensemble variance.
	6.	Score via UCB and risk-adjusted acquisition.
	7.	Select final candidate from shortlist.
	8.	Log all parameters for reproducibility.

This design explicitly separates:
	•	Prediction (surrogate)
	•	Exploration logic (UCB)
	•	Risk control (penalties)
	•	Final selection (shortlist decoding)

4. Performance

Performance was evaluated across eight black-box functions.

Metrics used:
	•	Observed improvement in objective value per round
	•	Stability of surrogate CV MSE
	•	Reduction in predictive uncertainty
	•	Consistency of improvement trends across rounds

The approach demonstrated:
	•	Progressive concentration in promising regions.
	•	Reduced instability in later rounds.
	•	Improved robustness compared to purely greedy selection.

However, due to limited samples (~19 points), performance cannot be interpreted as globally optimal.

5. Assumptions and Limitations

Key Assumptions
	•	Objective functions are smooth enough for RBF kernels.
	•	Bootstrap ensemble variance is a reasonable proxy for epistemic uncertainty.
	•	Promising regions remain locally exploitable over rounds.
	•	Penalising boundaries reduces pathological solutions.

Limitations
	•	Sparse sampling in higher dimensions.
	•	Uncertainty is heuristic rather than fully Bayesian.
	•	Local sampling may reinforce early biases.
	•	Computational budget limits candidate density.
	•	Risk penalties may suppress legitimate boundary optima.

Failure modes include:
	•	Missing narrow global optima.
	•	Over-exploitation of suboptimal basins.
	•	Underestimating true uncertainty.

6. Ethical Considerations and Transparency

This optimisation framework emphasises transparency:
	•	Full run records saved per function.
	•	Hyperparameters, uncertainty measures and exploration settings logged.
	•	Deterministic seeds ensure reproducibility.
	•	Candidate selection logic explicitly documented.

Transparency supports:
	•	Reproducibility
	•	Auditability of optimisation decisions
	•	Responsible adaptation to other domains
	•	Critical evaluation of assumptions

The structured logging and documentation reduce the risk of opaque decision-making often associated with automated optimisation.

7. Strengths and Limitations of the Model Card

This model card documents:
	•	Algorithmic structure
	•	Evolution across rounds
	•	Assumptions
	•	Reproducibility mechanisms

Adding more low-level implementation detail (e.g., exact constant values per round) would increase verbosity but not substantially improve clarity. The current structure balances interpretability and conciseness, making it suitable for academic evaluation and peer review.

Summary

RA-KRR-UCB v1.0 is a structured, uncertainty-aware black-box optimisation strategy designed for transparent, reproducible iterative search. It balances exploration, exploitation and risk control while explicitly logging its decision process. Although effective for incremental optimisation under data scarcity, its assumptions about smoothness and uncertainty estimation limit guarantees of global optimality.
